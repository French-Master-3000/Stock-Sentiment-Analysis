# Stock and News Sentiment Analysis

This project explores if news sentiment affects the stock market. I used Python to analyze how sentiment scores from news headlines relate to stock price movements.

## What it does

* **Analyzes Data:** It uses a dataset with both stock prices and news sentiment scores.
* **Creates Features:** It makes new features like moving averages and lagged values to help predict stock changes.
* **Trains Models:** It uses machine learning models like `RandomForestRegressor` and `XGBoost` to try and predict daily stock returns.
* **Checks Results:** It compares how well the different models perform to see if sentiment helps in predicting stock movements.

## How to use it

1.  Make sure you have all the required Python libraries.
2.  Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
3.  Run the code cells one by one to see the analysis and results.
